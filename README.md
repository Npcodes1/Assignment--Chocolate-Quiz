# Chocolate Quiz

- Are you a chocolate lover? Do you think you know everything about chocolate? Take this simple trivia quiz to find out!

# Purpose

- I made this quiz as part of an assignment for the CodeSquad 2024 Mini Course I'm taking. The purpose of this project was to build a basic html site that involved linking pages, adding images, and writing proper html code. I was able to pick any topic I chose to for creating the quiz, so I decided to do one on chocolate to appeal to my love of it. I also added some personal touches by adding a little CSS to change the background color and add a border.
   
-  I'm doing a Mini Course to gain acceptance into CodeSquad's 2024 Full Stack Bootcamp.
